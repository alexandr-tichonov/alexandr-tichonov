**Aspiring SOC Analyst | Security+ | PJPT | PNPT | Building hands-on projects in SOC automation and defensive security**  

## Introduction  

My journey in computer science sparked a strong interest in cybersecurity, where technical problem-solving delivers real-world results. Contributing to a development project introduced me to secure coding practices and inspired my focus on security concepts and defense strategies.

Since then, I have earned the **CompTIA Security+**, **PJPT**, and **PNPT** certifications, and completed projects such as a **SOC automation workflow with Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive** to deepen my understanding of detection and response.  

My immediate goal is to join a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a Tier 1 Analyst and further develop my skills by pursuing the **Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA)** and **Blue Team Level 2** certifications. In the long term, I aim to move into **penetration testing**, leveraging both defensive and offensive expertise to help organizations address emerging threats.
